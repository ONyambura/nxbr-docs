> > _N Developments strongly recommends replacing your current targeting system with `ox_target`. It's faster, more reliable, and fully compatible with popular systems like `qtarget` and `qb-target` — no need to refactor your entire codebase._

The **Sit Anywhere System** by **N Developments** allows players and admins to interact with the world like never before. This resource gives you full control over placing **custom sitting spots** on any object — whether it's a chair, rock, dumpster, bench, or something as random as a mailbox.

All sitting locations are **fully interactable** through `ox_target`, giving a natural and immersive feel to roleplay environments.



#### 🛠 Features:

* ✅ **Create sittable spots** anywhere, on any prop or object
* ✅ **Real-time placement** — no server restart required
* ✅ **Built-in admin removal option** via `ox_target`
* ✅ **Persistent or temporary spots** depending on how you use it
* ✅ **Works great for events, cafes, parks, and RP hotzones**
